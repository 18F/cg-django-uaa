This is a cloud.gov UAA authentication backend for Django. It also
includes a handy "fake cloud.gov" that makes it easy to log in
as any user during development.

To get started, see the :ref:`quickstart`.

.. warning:: This package is in a very early stage of development
   and its settings and/or API will likely change in the near future.
